  availableDialogues:
  - Hello adventurer, you must be the one who just received a trust from the guild.
    I'm Keegan - a guild member.
  - This dungeon I discovered not long ago while searching for materials. Because
    my forte isn't fighting, I didn't dare to explore it, so I don't know much about
    this dungeon.
  - However, I know of one type of monster that is a SKELETON and they don't seem
    to come out of the dungeon (because when I found the dungeon I was hunted by
    it).
  - Please be careful, if it's too dangerous, run out of the dungeon. I will stay
    here and wait for good news from you.
  acceptedDialogues:
  - There seem to be a lot of monsters so please be careful when entering!
  completedDialogues:
  - It's been hard for you. Let's go back to the 'Dawkins' guild master.
  - This is your reward.
