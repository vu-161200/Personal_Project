  - A while ago, 'Moongarde' - a branch of our guild was attacked and occupied by
    monsters. We've sent a few people in to probe but we haven't been able to get
    deep inside. Therefore, we ask for your help.

    We've prepared them, you can get them in the small room at the bottom of the
    floor.
