  availableDialogues:
  - OH, how did you get in here, you must be from the general guild. I am Tyeis -
    the daughter of 'Mcbostrom' the owner of this guild branch.
  - Please be careful, these GOBLINs are very evil, they killed most of the people
    in the guild including my father, and I don't know the whereabouts of the others
    (probably killed).
  - According to the information I've gathered, the boss is usually in the guild
    master's room on the 2nd floor and the command is given to the captain.
  - Just now, listening to the prison guards talking to each other, the current captain
    was in the kitchen and he was also the one holding the key to the prison. Therefore,
    please deal with him.
  acceptedDialogues:
  - Please be careful and avoid panicking the surrounding monsters. With your bravery,
    dealing with the commander is not difficult. Please start now.
  completedDialogues:
  - Thank you very much, let's get out of here and prepare to clean up the monsters.
