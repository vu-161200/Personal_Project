  - Oh, it looks like you're an adventurer that has been entrusted with our guild.
    I'm Dennis - the captain sent here.
  - 'You arrived just in time for us to spy on some useful information for you: The
    attacking monsters don''t seem to be many, mainly GOBLINs, led by a boss and
    they are very loose guard so it''s easy Intrusion.'
  - Therefore, we ask you to spy on the situation inside first, especially the prison
    - where they keep everyone.
  acceptedDialogues:
  - Please be careful when scouting the situation inside, don't alarm the monsters!
  completedDialogues:
  - The monsters are brutal, fortunately they haven't killed the lady 'Tyeis' yet.
    Please rest while I summarize the situation.
  - We will soon clear the monsters to avenge everyone in the guild branch who died.
