  - Thanks to you, we succeeded in recapturing this branch and rescuing Lady 'Tyeis'.
    We are very grateful for that.
  - Luckily you haven't left our guild yet, we just discovered an underground dungeon.
    Since you have just completed the above entrustment, we would like you to carry
    out this entrustment as well.
  - Please go to that location and meet 'Keegan' who discovered the dungeon for more
    information and quests.
  - Before departing, you can visit 'Leroy' - a fairly famous merchant who has just
    taken a break from our guild to replenish the necessary items. Good luck to you!
  acceptedDialogues:
  - The commission this time is quite difficult and dangerous, so be careful! We
    trust you to get it done.
  completedDialogues:
  - You have successfully completed the commission even though it is very dangerous.
    Please accept our reward!
